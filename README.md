# Challenge_3_crypto_arbitrage

## Purpose
This project shows the potential arbitrage opportunities with the digital asset Bitcoin. The two exchanges being compared are Bitstamp and Coinbase, with the closing price being one of the main parameters. Arbitrage is the almost-simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a difference in the asset's price between markets.
## Technology
Utilizes Python language, Pandas data analysis, matplot lib graphs. Jupyter Lab
## Usage
To see the crypto arbitrage opportunities download the Starter_Code and then open Jupyter Lab to run the code. There are several visualizations and statistics generated to help understanding. The point of this project is to show how important it is to leverage with programming and pandas to help find/measure arbitrage opportunities in markets.
